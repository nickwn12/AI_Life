This project I wanted to make a snake that would be able to slither fowards.
I had a lot of trouble getting the snake to slither but I found that by making it 
longer, stronger, and able to have different widths for the different body parts
The Fitness function is based soley off how far fowards it can propell itself. 
This is a video of the snake functioning.

You can create the snake by running the search python file which does everything that it needs to do.
