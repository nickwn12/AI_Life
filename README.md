The way that this program works there is an initial cube that can eb made
once you have the intial cube when you mutate it you add a cube of  a random size on a free side that has not been taken
Before you add the cube you make sure that the Cube will not overlap with any of the other cubes in order to make sure that there is no overlap
Once you do that you have the way that the body is made
The brain is made by connecting each sensor to each motor. There are no hidden neurons but tbh this homework was enough work as is and I did not have time to add it in.
